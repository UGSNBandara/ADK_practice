Okay, here's a brief, emoji-filled note about DatabaseSessionService for your README file:

💾 DatabaseSessionService 💾

What it does: ⚙️ Automatically saves and retrieves your agent's session data (memory) to a database.

Why use it? ➡️ Makes your agent remember things across turns and application restarts! 🧠

How it works: 🪄 Handles the database interactions behind the scenes. You just work with the session.state dictionary.

Supported DBs: ✅ SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, and more!

Key Benefit: Persistence! 💾 Your agent's memory survives restarts. 🚀
