1. Runner

In the Google ADK, the Runner is essentially the execution engine for your agent. Think of it as the orchestrator or the driver that takes an agent and makes it "run" or execute its logic in response to inputs.

What it does:

:white_check_mark: Receives Input: It takes the initial input (e.g., a user's message, an API call, an event).

:white_check_mark: Invokes the Agent: It passes this input to your defined agent (e.g., an LLMAgent, SequentialAgent, etc.).

:white_check_mark: Manages Execution Flow: It handles the steps the agent takes, including:
Calling the underlying LLM (for LLMAgent).
Invoking tools the agent decides to use.
Managing the flow between sub-agents in a multi-agent system.

:white_check_mark: Produces Output: It collects the agent's response or the outcome of its actions.

:white_check_mark: Manages Sessions: Crucially, the Runner is often tied to a session manager that maintains the State of the conversation across multiple turns.

:white_check_mark: Event Generation: As the agent executes, the Runner generates Session Events that log what's happening.

:white_check_mark: Analogy: If your agent is a skilled chef, the Runner is the kitchen manager who takes the customer's order, tells the chef what to cook, provides ingredients (tools), makes sure everything goes in the right order, and ultimately presents the meal to the customer.

2. Session Event

A Session Event is a record of something significant that happens during an agent's execution within a session. Think of it as an entry in a detailed logbook for a specific conversation.

What it captures:

:white_check_mark: Input Received: When a new message or input comes into the session.
:white_check_mark: Agent Decision: What the agent decided to do next (e.g., "called tool 'GoogleSearch'", "responded with text").
:white_check_mark: Tool Call: When a tool is invoked, including its input parameters.
:white_check_mark: Tool Result: The output or result received from a tool.
:white_check_mark: Agent Response: The final text or artifact produced by the agent.
Internal Thoughts/Reasoning (for LLMAgent): Often, LLM-based agents will have internal "thoughts" or reasoning steps before making a decision. These can also be logged as events.
:white_check_mark: Errors: Any issues or errors encountered during execution.
Why it's important:

  Debugging: Essential for understanding why an agent behaved a certain way. You can trace the entire execution flow.
  Monitoring: Provides insights into agent performance and common execution paths.
  Evaluation: Crucial for evaluating agent quality, as you can see the step-by-step reasoning and tool usage.
  Auditing: Provides a transparent record of interactions.
  Analogy: Continuing the chef analogy, a Session Event is like the kitchen logbook that records every order taken, every ingredient     
           fetched, every cooking step, every dish served, and any unexpected issues.

3. State
   
State refers to the current context and memory of a specific conversation or interaction session with an agent. It's the information the agent needs to remember to have a continuous and coherent discussion with a user over multiple turns.

What it typically includes:

:white_check_mark: Conversation History: The sequence of previous messages exchanged between the user and the agent. This is the most fundamental part of session state.
:white_check_mark: Internal Agent Memory: Any specific facts or variables the agent decided to store for the duration of the conversation.
:white_check_mark: Tool Call Results (sometimes): The results of previous tool calls that might be relevant for future turns.
:white_check_mark: User Information: If available, data about the specific user interacting with the agent.

Why it's important:

:white_check_mark: Continuity: Allows the agent to remember what was discussed previously, making the conversation feel natural and allowing for follow-up questions. Without state, every interaction would be like starting a brand new conversation.
:white_check_mark: Example: User asks "What's the weather in London?" (Agent knows London). User then asks "And in Paris?" (Agent remembers the context is "weather" and applies it to Paris).
:white_check_mark: Coherence: Ensures that the agent's responses are relevant to the ongoing dialogue.
:white_check_mark: Personalization: Enables agents to tailor responses based on past interactions or known user preferences within that session.

How it's managed:

The ADK's session manager is responsible for persisting and retrieving this state between turns.
As discussed, this state can be stored:
In-memory: For transient local testing.
Vertex AI Agent Engine: For scalable and persistent production use.
Custom Database: For more control over persistent storage.
Analogy: The State is the chef's working memory or the order ticket for a specific table. It contains all the details about what that particular customer has ordered so far, any special requests, and what stage their meal is at. This memory allows the chef to continue preparing the meal without having to ask the customer to repeat their entire order every few minutes.

Relationship between the three:

The Runner executes the agent's logic.
During this execution, the Runner relies on and updates the State to maintain conversational context.
As the Runner executes, it generates Session Events that log the various actions and decisions made by the agent within that State.
Together, these three components ensure that ADK agents can have intelligent, continuous, and transparent interactions.
