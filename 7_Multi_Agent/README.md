🤖 Multi-Agent Systems in Google ADK 🤝

Building complex AI applications often goes beyond what a single agent can do. That's where Multi-Agent Systems come in! It's like building a highly specialized team where each member (agent) plays a specific role to achieve a bigger goal.

🎯 What are Multi-Agent Systems?

A Multi-Agent System in ADK is a setup where multiple distinct AI agents collaborate to solve a problem or complete a task that would be difficult or inefficient for a single agent alone.

Analogy: Imagine running a small company. You wouldn't expect one person to handle sales, marketing, engineering, and customer support perfectly. Instead, you hire specialized individuals for each role. A multi-agent system works similarly, with different agents handling different aspects of a user's request.

✨ Why Use Multi-Agent Systems?

Specialization & Modularity: 🛠️

Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
Each sub-agent can be highly specialized in its domain (e.g., a "Search Agent," a "Code Generation Agent," a "Data Analysis Agent").
Makes agents easier to develop, test, and maintain independently.
Robustness & Resilience: 💪

If one sub-agent encounters an issue, the manager agent can potentially retry, delegate to an alternative, or provide graceful error handling.

Scalability: 📈

Different parts of a task can be processed in parallel by different sub-agents (e.g., using ParallelAgent).
Distribute computational load across specialized components.
Complex Reasoning: 🧠

Allows for more sophisticated, multi-step reasoning by chaining together the capabilities of different agents. One agent's output can be another agent's input.

🏗️ How They Work in Google ADK

In ADK, multi-agent systems often follow a hierarchical or orchestrated pattern:

The Manager/Orchestrator Agent (The Boss): 🧑‍💼

Role: This is the primary entry point for user queries. It's responsible for understanding the overall task, breaking it down, deciding which sub-agents are needed, delegating tasks to them, and synthesizing their results into a final, coherent response for the user.

Implementation: Often an LLMAgent for dynamic decision-making, or a SequentialAgent/ParallelAgent for more structured workflows.

User Interaction: Typically, only the Manager Agent directly communicates with the human user.

Sub-Agents (The Specialists): 👩‍🔧👨‍💻

Role: These are specialized agents designed to perform very specific functions. They execute the sub-tasks delegated by the Manager Agent.

Implementation: Can be LLMAgents (if they need to use tools or reason within their specialty) or even simpler WorkflowAgents if their task is highly structured.

User Interaction: Generally do not directly interact with the user. Their outputs are returned to the Manager Agent.
Communication & State Sharing: 💬↔️🧠

Shared Session State: All agents operating within the same session (manager and sub-agents) typically have access to the same session.state. This shared memory is crucial for passing information and context between agents and ensuring continuity.

Tool Invocation: Agents can pass data to each other through tool invocations. An LLMAgent (manager or sub-agent) might call a tool (which could even be another agent exposed as a tool – AgentTool) passing relevant arguments derived from the shared state or the current query.
